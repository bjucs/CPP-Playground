# About
This C++ playground repository is for my personal experimentation & learning purposes while following along and reading `Accelerated C++, Practical Programming by Example`, by Andrew Koenig and Barbara E. Moo. My goal is to learn the fundamentals of programming in C++ from a practical perspective - not necessarily those of a systems-level purist designing their own libraries akin to raw C. 

You'll find my personal notes in the margins of programs, as well as (typically) the specific chapters and sections I'm following at the time. 

# More Info
Generally speaking, you can compile most of these programs simply by running `g++ <program-name.cc> -o <program-name>`, although you can really name the executable (second part of the command) whatever you'd like.
